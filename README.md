First things first you will need to download node.js http://nodejs.org/ and git http://git-scm.com/downloads

Then you will want to clone the git repo:
  - open your terminal and naviagte to where you want the directory to be
  - type <code>git clone https://github.com/pollardld/email_PEDs.git</code>

Next type <code>git status</code> just to make sure everything is clean.

You can now open up the project in your IDE and do whatevers.

Made some changes, ready to make a commit?
  - open up your terminal and naviagte into the root directory of email_PEDs (if not already there).
  - type <code>git init</code>
  - type <code>git add .</code> this will add all changed files, if you only want to add one of your files replace the . with the file name or directory.
  - type <code>git commit -m '</code> add a message describing what you did like <code>updated index.js'</code>
  - now time to add the remote repo <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/pollardld/email_PEDs.git</code>
  - then push that shit <code>git push origin master</code>

Any more commits will not require the git remote add origin step.
